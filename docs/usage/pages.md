## Pages <span class='label label-yellow'>since 1.24.0</span>

Do you need a custom page where you can add content for your instance? A detailed policy page? A guide on how to post events?  
In the **Admin > Pages**  section you can create as many as you like.

Each page will have its own specific link that you can use as you like, such as adding a link to the footer (in the Theme section) or referencing it in the about page.

To find the link to a page you can copy it from the preview link.

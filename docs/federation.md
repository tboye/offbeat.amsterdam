## Federation / ActivityPub

Gancio largely follows ActivityPub's server-to-server specification.

- [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net/)
- [HTTP Signatures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures)
- [NodeInfo](https://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/)

## Supported FEPs

## ActivityPub

Each instance has only one [AP Actor](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#actors) of type `Application` named `events@instance.tld` by default (was `relay` before 1.24), which publishes each event as [Event](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-event) type.  
Each AP enabled software could decide how to interact with coming events, e.g. on Mastodon and forks you can see it with minimal information, with Friendica events are added into your own calendar, GoToSocial does not support [Event](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-event) type.

We are considering the introduction of other `Actor` but they will not be linked to users, rather to places, tags or collections.
There are no personal timeline of people you follow, everyone has a sort of local timeline of the instance, itâ€™s an anti filter-bubble feature.

Since v1.10.0 each instance could follow other instances or actors (`Admin > Federation > Add trusted node`) and use the events incoming from the federation to fill choosen collections (`Admin > Collections`).

Note that events coming from the federation will be removed after the end.

All federation's related operations uses `/federation` as endpoint. You can disable it via a specific setting (`Admin > Federation > Disable federation`).

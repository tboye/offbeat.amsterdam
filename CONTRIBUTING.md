## Bug reports

Bug reports and feature suggestions must use descriptive and concise titles and be submitted to [Framagit Issues](https://framagit.org/les/gancio/-/issues).  
Please use the search function to make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected.

## Translations

You can submit translations via [weblate.org](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gancio/). Note that if you want to change some label for your own instance [you can do it](https://gancio.org/install/config#user-locale).


## Code

Building software means taking a stand, making decisions, choices: you can read our choices on [the homepage](https://gancio.org)

To help with issues you can check for [Contibution welcome](https://framagit.org/les/gancio/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Contribution%20welcome&first_page_size=100), [good first issue](https://framagit.org/les/gancio/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=good%20first%20issue&first_page_size=100 ) or [help needed](https://framagit.org/les/gancio/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=good%20first%20issue&first_page_size=100) tags.

**Please use clean, concise titles for your pull requests.** Unless the pull request is about refactoring code or other internal tasks, assume that the person reading the pull request title is not a programmer but an user and **try to describe your change or fix from their perspective**. We use commit squashing, so the final commit in the main branch will carry the title of the pull request, and commits from the main branch are fed into the changelog.  
Please use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in your commit messages.  
Please make forks you want to merge upstream public and possibly [allow commits](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/allow_collaboration/#allow-commits-from-upstream-members) from upstream members when requesting a merge request.


**The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged.** Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable.



## Documentation
As you can see there is a big space for improvements here :smile:
